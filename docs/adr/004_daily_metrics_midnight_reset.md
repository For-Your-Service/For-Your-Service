## 🎯 Context & Problem Statement
Transitioning service members require low-latency, deterministic, and accurate career intelligence. Platform architecture must remain secure, highly resilient, and zero-cost where possible.

Engineered atomic daily date-checking metric store that automatically initializes at 0 at midnight and ticks up live with real visitor and recruiter engagement.

## 📊 Consequences
- **Positive:** Increased platform stability, zero external SaaS lock-in, immediate test verification.
- **Negative:** Requires rigorous local schema maintenance across multi-branch military datasets.
