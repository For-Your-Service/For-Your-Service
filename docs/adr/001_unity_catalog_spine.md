## 🎯 Context & Problem Statement
Transitioning service members require low-latency, deterministic, and accurate career intelligence. Platform architecture must remain secure, highly resilient, and zero-cost where possible.

## 💡 Decision
Standardized on workspace.fys_bronze, workspace.fys_silver, and workspace.fys_gold across all Databricks workloads for strict enterprise data governance and auditability.

## 📊 Consequences
- **Positive:** Increased platform stability, zero external SaaS lock-in, immediate test verification.
- **Negative:** Requires rigorous local schema maintenance across multi-branch military datasets.
